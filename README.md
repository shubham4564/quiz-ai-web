## üÜò Troubleshooting

### PDF Upload Issues
- Ensure the file is a valid PDF
- Check file size (< 10MB recommended)
- Try a different PDF if extraction fails

### AI Generation Issues
- Verify API key is correct / not expired
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure you have API quota remaining
- If you get fewer questions than requested, the app now tries multiple supplemental batches. If it still fails, try: (1) requesting fewer questions, (2) providing a richer / larger PDF, or (3) reducing repeated/boilerplate pages.

### Quiz Not Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
