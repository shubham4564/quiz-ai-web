# üéì AI-Powered Quiz Dashboard

A modern, feature-rich quiz application with AI-powered quiz generation from PDF documents using Google's Gemini AI.

## ‚ú® Features

### üè† Home Dashboard
- Clean, modern interface with light and dark modes.
- Easy navigation between quiz and admin sections.
- Collapsible ‚ÄúQuick Guide‚Äù panel (Show / Hide) for instant onboarding.
- Versioned list of previously generated quizzes with open & delete actions.

### üìñ Quiz Taking
- **Interactive Quiz Interface**:
  - Progress tracking for questions.
  - **Instant Feedback**: Click an answer to see if you're right or wrong immediately.
  - **Detailed Explanations**: After answering, view explanations for all four options to understand the reasoning.
  - **Hint System**: Get a helpful hint for each question.
  - Smooth animations and a user-friendly design.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Admin Panel (Open Access in Demo)
No password is required in this demo build (previous password gating was removed for simplicity). Two methods to create quizzes:

#### ü§ñ AI-Powered Generation
- **Upload PDF Documents**: Drag-and-drop or click to upload.
- **Customizable Quiz Length**: Choose how many questions to generate.
- **Automatic Quiz Generation**: Uses Google Gemini AI (dynamic model discovery prioritizing current Pro / Flash models; falls back gracefully) to create questions with:
  - Four multiple-choice options.
  - A correct answer marked.
  - A helpful hint.
  - A unique explanation for each of the four options.
- **On-Page Status**: Get real-time feedback on the generation process without disruptive popups.
- **Persistent Saved Quizzes**: Each successful generation from a PDF is stored and named automatically: `<FileBaseName> Quiz N` (e.g., `Lecture1 Quiz 1`, then `Lecture1 Quiz 2`). These appear under "Saved Quizzes" on the Home screen.
- **Per-Quiz Management**: Click a saved quiz to open that exact version; delete individual quizzes without affecting others.
- **Strict Completeness**: Partial generations are never saved (ensures consistency & comparability between versions).

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Manual JSON Entry
- Add questions in bulk using a specific JSON format.
- Collapsible instructions with a clear format guide.
- Real-time validation and status messages.

## üìù JSON Format

The JSON must be an array of question objects. Each option within a question must have its own explanation.

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "hint": "It's a famous European city known for art and romance.",
    "options": [
      {
        "text": "London",
        "correct": false,
        "explanation": "London is the capital of the United Kingdom, not France."
      },
      {
        "text": "Paris",
        "correct": true,
        "explanation": "Correct! Paris is the capital and most populous city of France."
      },
      {
        "text": "Berlin",
        "correct": false,
        "explanation": "Berlin is the capital of Germany."
      },
      {
        "text": "Madrid",
        "correct": false,
        "explanation": "Madrid is the capital of Spain."
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Required Fields:
- `question` (string): The question text.
- `hint` (string): A hint for the user.
- `options` (array of 4 objects): The answer choices.
  - `text` (string): The option's text.
  - `correct` (boolean): `true` for the correct answer, `false` otherwise.
  - `explanation` (string): An explanation specific to that option.

  - `correct`: Boolean - Only ONE should be true
- `hint`: String (optional) - A helpful hint
- `explanation`: String (optional) - Explanation of the correct answer

## üé® Features in Detail

### Hint System
- Click the üí° button to toggle hints
- Hints provide guidance without revealing the answer
- Can be shown/hidden at any time

### Explanation System
- Automatic feedback after submitting an answer
- ‚úÖ Green box for correct answers
- ‚ùå Red box for incorrect answers
- One-sentence explanation of why the answer is correct

### Question Jump Navigation
- A compact navigation bar shows numbered buttons for every question.
- Colors indicate status: Blue (current), Green (correct), Red (wrong), Yellow (answered ‚Äì pending correctness classification), Neutral (unvisited).
- Click any number to jump directly without losing recorded answers.
- Updates live after each submission.

### AI Generation
- Uses Google Gemini API with dynamic model discovery (prefers current Pro / Flash variants; falls back to a stable known list if discovery fails)
- Analyzes PDF content intelligently
- Generates diverse, non-overlapping questions (regeneration enforces novelty)
- Automatically adds hints and explanations (or fills defaults)
- Robust JSON handling: repairs malformed output, salvages valid objects, and supplements missing questions
- Attempts supplemental batches until the exact requested count is reached; does not save partial sets
- Automatically archives the successful set into a versioned list tied to the original PDF filename for iterative quiz builds.

### Saved Quizzes
- Each AI (or migrated legacy) quiz is stored as an immutable snapshot.
- Naming: Base name comes from uploaded PDF filename (without extension) plus incrementing index.
- Opening a saved quiz sets it as the active quiz (and loads into the quiz view).
- Deleting affects only that snapshot; others remain intact.
- Clearing all quiz data (Danger Zone) also clears the entire saved collection (undo available for the current session).

### Quick Guide Toggle
- Located at the top of the Home view.
- Collapsible button shows/hides onboarding instructions.
- Independent from the Manual Entry instructions toggle.

### Data Persistence
- `quizCollections`: Stores array of quiz snapshot metadata + questions + activeQuizId.
- `quizData`: Current quiz questions loaded for play (mirrors active snapshot for compatibility).
- `theme`: Stores selected theme (light / dark).
- All data lives solely in `localStorage`; clearing browser data wipes it.

### Footer Credit
- A subtle fixed footer credit: ‚ÄúMade by SHjoshi‚Äù.
- Non-interactive (can be turned into a link if needed).

### Score Display
- Shows correct/incorrect count
- Displays percentage score
- Color-coded performance:
  - üèÜ 90%+ - Outstanding!
  - üåü 70-89% - Excellent!
  - üëç 50-69% - Good effort!
  - üìö Below 50% - Keep practicing!

## üîí Security Notes

- Demo build: admin panel is open (no password). In production add real auth.
- API keys are kept client-side only for requests directly to Gemini.
- No server stores your data; quiz data lives in `localStorage`.

## üí° Tips

1. **For Best Results with AI**:
   - Upload clear, well-formatted PDFs
   - PDFs with 10-50 pages work best
   - Educational content generates better questions
   
2. **For Manual Entry**:
   - Use the "Show Instructions" button
   - Copy the example template
   - Validate JSON before pasting (use jsonlint.com)
   - Include hints and explanations for better learning

3. **Taking Quizzes**:
   - Use hints strategically
   - Read explanations carefully
   - Retake quizzes to improve scores

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Modern gradients, animations, flexbox)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- PDF.js (PDF parsing)
- Google Gemini AI API
- LocalStorage (for data persistence)

## üì± Responsive Design

- Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Adaptive layout
- Touch-friendly interface

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### PDF Upload Issues
- Ensure the file is a valid PDF
- Check file size (< 10MB recommended)
- Try a different PDF if extraction fails

### AI Generation Issues
- Verify API key is correct / not expired
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure you have API quota remaining
- If you get fewer questions than requested, the app now tries multiple supplemental batches. If it still fails, try: (1) requesting fewer questions, (2) providing a richer / larger PDF, or (3) reducing repeated/boilerplate pages.

### Quiz Not Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
### Saved Quizzes Not Appearing
- Ensure at least one full quiz was generated (partial sets are discarded)
- Confirm browser localStorage is enabled (uses key `quizCollections`)
- Using incognito / clearing site data will remove saved entries
